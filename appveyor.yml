# This file is used to configure the AppVeyor CI system, for testing on Windows machines.

# Code loosely based on https://github.com/ogrisel/python-appveyor-demo
# 
# To test with AppVeyor:
#    Register on appveyor.com with your GitHub account.
#    Create a new appveyor project, using the GitHub details.
#    Ideally, configure notifications to post back to GitHub. (Untested)
