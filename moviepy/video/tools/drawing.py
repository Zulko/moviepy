    The result is a picture of size ``size``, whose color varies
    gradually from color `col1` in position ``p1`` to color ``col2``
    in position ``p2``.
    
    If it is a RGB picture the result must be transformed into
    a 'uint8' array to be displayed normally:
     
     
    Parameters
    ------------      
    
    size
      Size (width, height) in pixels of the final picture/array.
    
    p1, p2
      Coordinates (x,y) in pixels of the limit point for ``col1``
      and ``col2``. The color 'before' ``p1`` is ``col1`` and it
      gradually changes in the direction of ``p2`` until it is ``col2``
      when it reaches ``p2``.
    
    vector
      A vector [x,y] in pixels that can be provided instead of ``p2``.
      ``p2`` is then defined as (p1 + vector).
    
    col1, col2
      Either floats between 0 and 1 (for gradients used in masks)
      or [R,G,B] arrays (for colored gradients).
               
    shape
      'linear', 'bilinear', or 'circular'.
      In a linear gradient the color varies in one direction,
      from point ``p1`` to point ``p2``.
      In a bilinear gradient it also varies symetrically form ``p1``
      in the other direction.
      In a circular gradient it goes from ``col1`` to ``col2`` in all
      directions.
    
    offset
      Real number between 0 and 1 indicating the fraction of the vector
      at which the gradient actually starts. For instance if ``offset``
      is 0.9 in a gradient going from p1 to p2, then the gradient will
      only occur near p2 (before that everything is of color ``col1``)
      If the offset is 0.9 in a radial gradient, the gradient will
      occur in the region located between 90% and 100% of the radius,
      this creates a blurry disc of radius d(p1,p2).  
    
    Returns
    --------
    
    image
      An Numpy array of dimensions (W,H,ncolors) of type float
      representing the image of the gradient.

    Parameters
    -----------
    
    x: (int)
      If provided, the image is splitted horizontally in x, the left
      region being region 1.
        
    y: (int)
      If provided, the image is splitted vertically in y, the top region
      being region 1.
    
    p1,p2:
      Positions (x1,y1),(x2,y2) in pixels, where the numbers can be
      floats. Region 1 is defined as the whole region on the left when
      going from ``p1`` to ``p2``.
    
    p1, vector:
      ``p1`` is (x1,y1) and vector (v1,v2), where the numbers can be
      floats. Region 1 is then the region on the left when starting
      in position ``p1`` and going in the direction given by ``vector``.
       
    gradient_width
      If not zero, the split is not sharp, but gradual over a region of
      width ``gradient_width`` (in pixels). This is preferable in many
      situations (for instance for antialiasing).
